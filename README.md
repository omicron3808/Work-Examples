# Examples of Work I have Done

## Examining the Change in Prices of Used Cars vs. Public Transportation Spending

In this project, my group used a used cars dataset and an FTA allocation dataset to determine how the prices of Luxury car brands and non-Luxury car brands are affected by changes in FTA allocations. This project included data analysis and visualizations of the datasets. This project represents a beginning-to-end process to answer a question using data. This project had a Project Proposal, a Data checkpoint, an EDA checkpoint, and a final product.

## Predicting Political Party Affiliation of House Members based on Stock Transaction

In this project, I used a dataset of stock transactions of members of the House of Representatives. I first performed EDA on the dataset to see some statistics such as the number of stock trades by party, the number of trades by Representatives, and certain stock ticker transactions broken down by party.

## Visualization

In this project, I used D3.js to make various visualizations describing a dataset of video game releases. In the folder, there is a preview of what the HTML looks like. But, since there are animations I included in some of the visualizations the pdf does not do the project justice. To have the visualizations render you have to use Visual Studio Code and run the HTML file using a live server.
