    "To begin, we first checked how much of each of the columns in our dataset had missing data, which is indicated by NaN or NA. We found that the column labeled \"franchise_make\", representing the different brands of vehicles, was missing data in approximately 19% of its rows, comprising a significant portion of the column data. Because one of our variables of interest in our research question is the brand of vehicles being sold, we dropped rows that have missing data in the \"franchise_make\" column. \n",

    "We then needed to examine if any zip codes in our reduced Used Cars dataset, smaller_cardf, did not appear in the dataset we use to associate US zip codes to each state, represented as zipdf. This was especially important because we are interested in state-specific data in our research goals. Both smaller_cardf and zipdf used a variety of data types to represent zip codes in their dataset such as integers and strings, so we further cleaned the data by standardizing all zip codes to be represented as strings. Additionally, some of the numerically lesser zip codes lacked 0 prefixes, which we addressed by using the zfill method so that each zip code is exactly 5 digits. As a result of both of these methods, we discovered a list of unrecognized zips that were not associated with any US state. We accordingly removed cars from our Used Cars dataset that corresponded with these unrecognized zips, so that our cleaned dataset could effectively track each car sale back to its state location."
